It is 11:01 PM now and I am writing my first blog post on my blog-site.
I do not have anything on my mind right now to write about something as I am pretty tired from setting up my blog-site, and I need to sleep too.
I always try to sleep at least 7 hours, but somehow I am always on my computer and never go to bed on time.
It is funny how I am writing this at 11 o'clock at night when I need to wake up tomorrow at 5 AM.

Anyways, I will just write why I decided to write shortly.
So, recently, I have been practicing typing on the [KeyBr] website to increase my typing speed. I have managed to reach a top speed
 of 72 Words Per minute. It is fun, but I decided to make it more fun, and I think you know what I am going to say. I have decided that instead
 of typing out random words in that website, I would write something for my blog.

So, this is my story of why I decided to blog.

Thank you for reading this blog and I hope you have a good day.
